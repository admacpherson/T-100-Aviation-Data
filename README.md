# T-100 Aviation Data Analysis
The goal of this repository is to provide insightful analysis of aviation data using various Python tools including `numpy` and `pandas`.

## About the data
The primary dataset is the U.S. DOT T-100 data for Q1 & Q2 of 2024. It is publicly available from the [Bureau of Transportation TranStats](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FMG). There are also various helper tables, sourced also from the Bereau of Transportation. These lookup tables translate T-100 codes into plain text. For example, WAC = 15, corresponds to the region of Rhode Island. All data used can be found in the üìÅ[`data`](https://github.com/admacpherson/T-100-Aviation-Data/tree/main/data) folder of this repository.
